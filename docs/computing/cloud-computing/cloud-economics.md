# Cloud Economics

## Summary

### Objectives

*By the end of this session you should be able to:*

* Explain how websites were hosted before the availability of cloud services (and virtual machines!)
* Explain what Capital Expenditure and Operational Expenditure is, discuss what the differences are between them, and explain how they are commonly treated differently by companies.
* Demonstrate how cloud computing costs can be calculated.
* Discuss the cost difference between cloud computing and traditional "on-premise" deployments.

### Key Points

* Cloud economics is the study of the benefits, costs, and principles of cloud computing.
* Before cloud computing you needed to have a physical server to store your website, having to buy all the equipment.
* With cloud computing, you can rent storage. You can pay to have a server storing your files, without having to buy and configure the hardware.
* Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) are purchases of significant goods or services that will be used to improve a company's performance in the future.
* Operating Expenses (OPEX) are the costs a company has for running its day-to-day operations.
* Determining the potential costs of cloud computing can be as complex as the technology itself. The cost is divided in three centers: Compute, Storage, Network.
* Some providers have a calculator to estimate the difference between TOC and cloud costs.
